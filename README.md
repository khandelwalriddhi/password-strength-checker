# Password Strength Checker

Welcome to the Password Strength Checker project! 

## About the Project

As part of my journey in learning JavaScript, I created this mini-project to practice and apply my skills. This Password Strength Checker validates if a password is weak, medium, or strong.

## Features

- Validates password strength
- Classifies passwords as weak, medium, or strong based on predefined criteria

## How to Use

1. Enter a password in the input field.
2. The checker will analyze the password and display its strength.

## Criteria for Strength

- **Weak:** Passwords with less than 4 characters.
- **Medium:** Passwords with 4-8 characters.
- **Strong:** Passwords with more than 8 characters.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the strength criteria
- Add more user feedback
- Improve the UI
